# 🏥HOSPITAL

- As an elder, will I be cared more by a human nurse or a robot one?
- For better diagnosis, should I take a human or a machine doctor?
- I’m living in a complete paranoia and angst since we discovered through genetic testing that
I might have a lung cancer in 20 years. What should I do?
